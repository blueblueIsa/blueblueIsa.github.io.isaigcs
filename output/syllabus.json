Details of the assessment35www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcseBack to contents pagePseudocodeThe following information sets out how pseudocode will appear within the examinations of this syllabus. Thenumbers and letters that appear at the end of a sub-heading provide a cross reference to the relevant sectionof the subject content.General styleFont style and sizePseudocode is presented in Courier New. The size of the font will be consistent throughout.IndentationLines are indented by four spaces to indicate that they are contained within a statement in a previous line.Where it is not possible to fit a statement on one line, any continuation lines are indented by two spaces fromthe margin. In cases where line numbering is used, this indentation may be omitted. Every effort will be made tomake sure that code statements are not longer than a line of code, unless this is necessary.Note that the THEN and ELSE clauses of an IF statement are indented by only two spaces. Cases in CASEstatements are also indented by only two spaces.CaseKeywords are in upper case, e.g. IF, REPEAT, PROCEDURE.Identifiers are in mixed case with upper case letters indicating the beginning of new words, e.g.NumberOfPlayers.Meta-variables – (symbols in the pseudocode that should be substituted by other symbols) are enclosed inangled brackets &lt; &gt;.Example – meta-variablesREPEAT&lt;Statements&gt;UNTIL &lt;Condition&gt;Lines and line numberingEach line representing a statement is numbered. However, when a statement runs over one line of text, thecontinuation lines are not numbered.",

Details of the assessment38www.cambridgeinternational.org/igcseBack to contents pageAssignmentsThe assignment operator is ←Assignments should be made in the following format:&lt;identifier&gt; ← &lt;value&gt;The identifier must refer to a variable (this can be an individual element in a data structure, such as an array oran abstract data type). The value may be any expression that evaluates to a value of the same data type as thevariable.Example – assignmentsCounter ← 0Counter ← Counter + 1TotalToPay ← NumberOfHours * HourlyRateArraysDeclaring arrays (8.2.1)Arrays are fixed-length structures of elements of identical data type, accessible by consecutive index numbers.It is good practice to explicitly state what the lower bound of the array (i.e. the index of the first element) isbecause this defaults to either 0 or 1 in different systems. Generally, a lower bound of 1 will be used.Square brackets are used to indicate the array indices.1D and 2D arrays are declared as follows (where l, l1, l2 are lower bounds and u, u1, u2 are upper bounds):DECLARE &lt;identifier&gt; : ARRAY[&lt;l&gt;:&lt;u&gt;] OF &lt;data type&gt;DECLARE &lt;identifier&gt; : ARRAY[&lt;l1&gt;:&lt;u1&gt;, &lt;l2&gt;:&lt;u2&gt;] OF &lt;data type&gt;Example – array declarationDECLARE StudentNames : ARRAY[1:30] OF STRINGDECLARE NoughtsAndCrosses : ARRAY[1:3, 1:3] OF CHARUsing arrays (8.2.1)In the main pseudocode statements, only one index value is used for each dimension in the square brackets.Example – using arraysStudentNames[1] ← &quot;Ali&quot;NoughtsAndCrosses[2,3] ← ꞌXꞌStudentNames[n+1] ← StudentNames[n]",

If the cases are more complex, the use of an IFstatement, rather than a CASE statement, should be considered.Each case clause is indented by two spaces. They can be considered as continuations of the CASE statementrather than new statements.Note that the case clauses are tested in sequence. When a case that applies is found, its statement isexecuted, and the CASE statement is complete. Control is passed to the statement after the ENDCASE. Anyremaining cases are not tested.If present, an OTHERWISE clause must be the last case. Its statement will be executed if none of the precedingcases apply.Example – formatted CASE statementINPUT MoveCASE OF MoveꞌWꞌ : Position ← Position – 10ꞌEꞌ : Position ← Position + 10ꞌAꞌ : Position ← Position – 1ꞌDꞌ : Position ← Position + 1OTHERWISE OUTPUT &quot;Beep&quot;ENDCASE",

RETURNS &lt;data type&gt;&lt;statements&gt;ENDFUNCTIONThe keyword RETURN is used as one of the statements within the body of the function to specify the value tobe returned. Normally, this will be the last statement in the function definition.Because a function returns a value that is used when the function is called, function calls are not completeprogram statements. The keyword CALL should not be used when calling a function. Functions should onlybe called as part of an expression. When the RETURN statement is executed, the value returned replaces thefunction call in the expression and the expression is then evaluated.",

The following file modes are used:• READ for data to be read from the file• WRITE for data to be written to the file. A new file will be created and any existing data in the file will belost.A file should be opened in only one mode at a time.Data is read from the file (after the file has been opened in READ mode) using the READFILE command asfollows:READFILE &lt;File Identifier&gt;, &lt;Variable&gt;When the command is executed, the data item is read and assigned to the variable.Data is written into the file after the file has been opened using the WRITEFILE command as follows:WRITEFILE &lt;File identifier&gt;, &lt;Variable&gt;When the command is executed, the data is written into the file. Files should be closed when they are no longerneeded using the CLOSEFILE command as follows:CLOSEFILE &lt;File identifier&gt;Example – file handling operationsThis example uses the operations together, to copy a line of text from FileA.txt to FileB.txtDECLARE LineOfText : STRINGOPENFILE &quot;FileA.txt&quot; FOR READOPENFILE &quot;FileB.txt&quot; FOR WRITEREADFILE &quot;FileA.txt&quot;, LineOfTextWRITEFILE &quot;FileB.txt&quot;, LineOfTextCLOSEFILE &quot;FileA.txt&quot;CLOSEFILE &quot;FileB.txt&quot;",
