The first character is a '+', followed by a 2-digit country code, for example: +20xxxxxxxxxx where 20 is the country code and x is a digit between 0 and 9 inclusive. The algorithm includes checks for the country codes: 44 for the UK and 20 for Egypt.\n\n(a) Write an algorithm using pseudocode to: input the telephone number, extract the 2-digit country code, output the matching country, output 'Unknown' if there is no matching country.\n\n(b) Explain how you could change the algorithm to repeatedly prompt for the telephone number until the number entered is 13 characters in length.",

    "question": "An algorithm has been written in pseudocode to generate a random integer between 1 and 100 inclusive and store the value in N. The user enters a guess for the number and the algorithm indicates whether the guess is higher or lower than the random number. The algorithm outputs the number of guesses when the user has correctly guessed the random number. Identify the line numbers of the four errors in the pseudocode and suggest a correction for each error.",
